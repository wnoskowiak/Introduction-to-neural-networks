    "Before we get started with Python, we'd like to spend a little bit of time discussing notebooks. You can write and execute Python code locally in your web browser with the help of a Jupyter notebook. Jupyter notebooks are extremely popular in the field of scientific computing due to the fact that they make it very simple to tinker with code and execute it in bits and pieces. Colab, on the other hand, is a flavor of Jupyter notebooks developed by Google. It is optimized for machine learning and data analysis and operates completely in the cloud. Colab is essentially an enhanced version of the Jupyter notebook; it is free, does not require any setup, comes preinstalled with a large number of packages, can easily be shared with the rest of the world, and benefits from free access to hardware accelerators such as GPUs.\n",
